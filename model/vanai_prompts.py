                    "2. There are 2 big parts to the problem here i.e. brokerage and international remittances.The way it works is that someone in India has to create a US Stocks brokerage account with an SEC registered broker. Then they have to make an international remittance to this broker, and only then they can finally start transacting. Fi solves this problem by partnering with a SEC regulated broker in the US i.e. Alpaca securities who is the broker vendor here, and with a banking partner in India i.e. Federal bank. Broker vendor enables buying and selling of securities and Federal bank enables adding and withdrawing funds from the USD wallet of the user. \n"
